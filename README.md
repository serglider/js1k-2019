# Discrete Fourier Transform

## Introduction

Draw your doodle in one stroke and the script will convert it in a set of sinusoids represented on your screen as moving circles. The method used for this transformation is called Discrete Fourier Transform.

## Files

`index.html` is a shim environment provided by the contest organizers.

`human-readable/app.js` is a place you might want to take a look to understand what's going on in the application.

 `src/app.js` is what was actually developed having in mind further minification. It was automatically minified into `dist/app.js` by the Gulp plugin.

Finally, `submission/app.js` is a result of aggressive minification by means of the [Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) and a couple of further tweaks. That's what was submitted to the competition.
